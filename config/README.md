# Setup Overview

## Install Snakemake
To install Snakemake, you can use conda, which is a package manager that simplifies the installation of software and its dependencies. You can create a new conda environment for Snakemake and install it using the following commands:

```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c nodefaults -n snakemake snakemake
conda activate snakemake
snakemake --help
```

Refer to the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for more installation options and details.

## Setup Instructions
- Before running the pipeline, ensure you have an environment with Snakemake and it is activated.
- You need to add species details to the pipeline (config and files).
- Your reads should be renamed according to the naming convention specified below.

## Folder Structure

### Species Folders

The project contains folders for different species, which each contain the raw data, processed data, and results for the particular species.

The species folders should be placed in the root folder of your pipeline.

#### Providing Raw Data
The pipeline supports automatically moving the raw reads to the `<species>/raw/reads/` folder as well as the reference to the `<species>/raw/ref/` folder. Simply provide the files in the `<species>` folder. Alternatively, you can manually move the files to the respective folders.
  - provide the raw reads in `<species>/raw/reads/` folder
  - provide the reference in `<species>/raw/ref/` folder

When adding a new species, make sure to 
- the species folder should be placed in the root folder of your pipeline
- add the folder name should match the species key which is defined in `config.yaml` below `species:` 

#### Folder Structure

All other folders will be created and populated automatically

- Folder `<species>/processed/` contains the intermediary files during processing. Most of these files are marked as temporary and will be deleted at the end of the pipeline. Some files are kept to allow reprocessing the pipeline from different points in case something fails.
- Folder `<species>/results/` contains the final results and reports. 

Everything related to a reference will have a `<reference>` folder under `processed`or `results`. Typically, only the `results` folder will contain information required for further analyis. In case more information is required, the original files can often be found in the `processed` folder. 

Some exemptions include `*.sam` and unsorted `*.bam` files. These are deleted to save storage space. Most other files are kept in order to allow reprocessing the pipeline from different points in case something fails. If a step should be repeated, the relevant files need to be deleted manually. 

#### RAW Reads Filenames

The pipeline expects input read files to follow a standardized naming convention:

```
<Individual>_[<FreeText>_]R<1/2>[_<FreeText>].fastq.gz
```

Following this convention ensures proper organization and automated processing within the pipeline.  

##### Filename Components:
- **`<Individual>`** – A unique identifier for the sample or individual.  
- **`<FreeText>`** – Any additional text or identifier that can be included in the filename. Typically, this is used to differentiate between different samples within the same individual, e.g. the same sample was extracted twice using different protocols.
- **`R<1/2>`** – Indicates the read pair number, typically `R1` for the first read and `R2` for the second read. If the data is single-end, only `R1` should be present.
- **`.fastq.gz`** – The expected file extension, indicating compressed FASTQ format. Only `.fastq.gz` files are supported.

#### Example:
```
Dmel01_DabneyProtocol_R1_001.fastq.gz
```

# Configuration File Structure for aDNA Pipeline (`config.yaml`)

The `config.yaml` file is used to configure the aDNA pipeline. It contains settings such as project name, the species list and the pipeline stages and their process steps.

All pipeline stages are enabled by default, so a minimal config containing only the project name and species list is sufficient to run the pipeline without any further changes:

```yaml
project_name: "pastForward_Project"

species:
  Dmel:
    name: "Drosophila melanogaster"
```

To adjust any pipeline settings, open [config_designer.html](config_designer.html) in a browser. The interactive Config Designer guides you through all available options and exports a ready-to-use `config.yaml`.

## Global Settings

* **project\_name**: Name of the project.

## Pipeline Settings

Defines the overall pipeline behavior, including execution controls and process details.

### Pipeline Stages and Process Steps

* The pipeline is broken into **stages** (e.g., `raw_reads_processing`, `reference_processing`).
* Each stage contains multiple **process steps** (e.g., `adapter_removal`, `deduplication`, ...).
* Both stages and process steps can be controlled with `execute: true/false` flags to enable or disable them.
* Some process steps include additional configurable settings (e.g., adapter sequences, database paths, ...).
* If an enabled process step requires data from a previous stage which is disabled in the config, the pipeline will execute the disabled process step anyway.

### Important Defaults

* You **do not need to specify all stages or process steps** explicitly.
* Any **stage or process step not provided in the config defaults to `execute: true`** and will be executed.

### Global Pipeline Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline.global.skip_existing_files` | `true` | When true, existing output files are skipped to avoid re-computation. |

### Stage: `raw_reads_processing`

Quality checking, adapter removal, quality filtering, merging, contamination analysis, and read count statistics of raw reads.

> **Read count statistics always run** — per-stage counts (raw → trimmed → quality-filtered) are written unconditionally as `{species}/results/reads/statistics/{species}_reads_counts.csv`.

#### `analysis`

Controls FastQC + MultiQC quality reports at each processing stage and read count visualisation. Individual stages are toggled via `settings`.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `settings.multiqc_raw_reads` | on | FastQC/MultiQC on raw reads. |
| `settings.multiqc_trimmed_reads` | on | FastQC/MultiQC on adapter-trimmed reads. |
| `settings.multiqc_quality_filtered_reads` | on | FastQC/MultiQC on quality-filtered reads. |
| `settings.multiqc_merged_reads` | on | FastQC/MultiQC on merged per-individual reads. |
| `settings.create_plots` | on | Generate read count bar plots per species. |

#### `adapter_removal`

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `settings.min_quality` | `0` | Minimum base quality score for adapter trimming. |
| `settings.min_length` | `0` | Minimum read length after adapter removal. |
| `settings.adapters_sequences.r1` | auto-detect | Adapter sequence for read 1. If omitted, fastp detects adapters automatically. |
| `settings.adapters_sequences.r2` | auto-detect | Adapter sequence for read 2. If omitted, fastp detects adapters automatically. |
| `settings.extra_params` | — | Optional extra parameters passed directly to fastp. |

#### `quality_filtering`

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `settings.min_quality` | `15` | Minimum base quality score for quality filtering. |
| `settings.min_length` | `30` | Minimum read length after quality filtering. |

#### `contamination_analysis`

Both tools operate on quality-filtered reads and can be toggled independently.

**ECMSD** — maps reads against a curated mitochondrial reference database.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tools.ecmsd.settings.database` | — | Path to the ECMSD database folder. If omitted, the pipeline auto-creates a database at `resources/ecmsd_database` via `ECMSD --create-db`. |
| `tools.ecmsd.settings.Binsize` | `1000` | Reference genome bin size for coverage calculation. |
| `tools.ecmsd.settings.RMUS_threshold` | `0.15` | Minimum Relative Mapping Uniqueness Score for a taxon to be reported. |
| `tools.ecmsd.settings.mapping_quality` | `20` | Minimum mapping quality score to include a read. |
| `tools.ecmsd.settings.taxonomic_hierarchy` | `species` | Taxonomic level at which to aggregate and report results. Options: `species`, `genus`, `family`, `order`. |

**Centrifuge** — k-mer-based taxonomic classification against a user-provided database.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tools.centrifuge.settings.include_human_taxid` | `false` | When true, the human taxid is included in the Centrifuge analysis. |
| `tools.centrifuge.settings.index` | — | Optional path to the Centrifuge index prefix. If omitted, the default index will be downloaded automatically. |
| `tools.centrifuge.settings.conda_env` | — | Optional path to a custom conda environment for Centrifuge. |

### Stage: `reference_processing`

Mapping, deduplication, damage analysis, coverage — runs per individual per reference.

#### `mapping`

Merged per-individual reads are mapped to the reference genome. Mapping always runs when Reference Processing is enabled.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `settings.mapper` | `bwa-mem2` | Mapper to use. Options: `bwa-aln` (classic seed-and-extend, recommended for short aDNA reads <70 bp), `bwa-mem2` (faster, for longer reads), `minimap2` (versatile, uses `-ax sr` preset for short reads). |
| `settings.mapper_extra_params` | — | Optional extra parameters passed directly to the mapper. For `bwa-aln`, defaults to `-n 0.01 -k 2 -l 1024 -o 2` (Oliva et al. 2021). |

#### `deduplication`

Removes PCR and sequencing duplicates using DeDup. Default: **off**.

| Setting | Default | Description |

| `settings.max_contigs_per_cluster` | `500` | Maximum number of contigs grouped per deduplication cluster. Lower values use less memory but increase runtime. Reduce (e.g. to 100) only for large, highly fragmented reference genomes. |

#### `filter_unmapped_reads`

Optionally removes or extracts reads that did not map to the reference. Default: **off**.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `settings.action` | `keep` | What to do with unmapped reads: `keep` — retain in final BAM (default, must be changed explicitly); `remove` — write a mapped-reads-only BAM; `extract_fastq` — write unmapped reads to a compressed FASTQ; `extract_fasta` — write unmapped reads to a compressed FASTA. |

#### Other `reference_processing` steps

| Step | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `damage_rescaling` | on | Profiles cytosine deamination and rescales base quality scores using mapDamage2. |
| `analysis` | on | Computes coverage breadth and mean depth; runs Qualimap and Preseq. Endogenous content data always generated. |
| `analysis.settings.damage_analysis` | on | Visualises damage patterns (mapDamage2) and includes them in the MultiQC report. |
