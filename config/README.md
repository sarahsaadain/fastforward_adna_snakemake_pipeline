# Setup Overview

## Install Snakemake
To install Snakemake, you can use conda, which is a package manager that simplifies the installation of software and its dependencies. You can create a new conda environment for Snakemake and install it using the following commands:

```bash
conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c nodefaults -n snakemake snakemake
conda activate snakemake
snakemake --help
```

Refer to the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) for more installation options and details.

## Setup Instructions
- Before running the pipeline, ensure you have an environment with Snakemake and it is activated.
- You need to add species details to the pipeline (config and files).
- Your reads should be renamed according to the naming convention specified below.

## Folder Structure

### Species Folders

The project contains folders for different species, which each contain the raw data, processed data, and results for the particular species.

The species folders should be placed in the root folder of your pipeline.

#### Providing Raw Data
The pipeline supports automatically moving the raw reads to the `<species>/raw/reads/` folder as well as the reference to the `<species>/raw/ref/` folder. Simply provide the files in the `<species>` folder. Alternatively, you can manually move the files to the respective folders.
  - provide the raw reads in `<species>/raw/reads/` folder
  - provide the reference in `<species>/raw/ref/` folder

When adding a new species, make sure to 
- the species folder should be placed in the root folder of your pipeline
- add the folder name should match the species key which is defined in `config.yaml` below `species:` 

#### Folder Structure

All other folders will be created and populated automatically

- Folder `<species>/processed/` contains the intermediary files during processing. Most of these files are marked as temporary and will be deleted at the end of the pipeline. Some files are kept to allow reprocessing the pipeline from different points in case something fails.
- Folder `<species>/results/` contains the final results and reports. 

Everything related to a reference will have a `<reference>` folder under `processed`or `results`. Typically, only the `results` folder will contain information required for further analyis. In case more information is required, the original files can often be found in the `processed` folder. 

Some exemptions include `*.sam` and unsorted `*.bam` files. These are deleted to save storage space. Most other files are kept in order to allow reprocessing the pipeline from different points in case something fails. If a step should be repeated, the relevant files need to be deleted manually. 

#### RAW Reads Filenames

The pipeline expects input read files to follow a standardized naming convention:

```
<Individual>_[<FreeText>_]R<1/2>[_<FreeText>].fastq.gz
```

Following this convention ensures proper organization and automated processing within the pipeline.  

##### Filename Components:
- **`<Individual>`** – A unique identifier for the sample or individual.  
- **`<FreeText>`** – Any additional text or identifier that can be included in the filename. Typically, this is used to differentiate between different samples within the same individual, e.g. the same sample was extracted twice using different protocols.
- **`R<1/2>`** – Indicates the read pair number, typically `R1` for the first read and `R2` for the second read. If the data is single-end, only `R1` should be present.
- **`.fastq.gz`** – The expected file extension, indicating compressed FASTQ format. Only `.fastq.gz` files are supported.

#### Example:
```
Dmel01_DabneyProtocol_R1_001.fastq.gz
```

# Configuration File Structure for aDNA Pipeline (`config.yaml`)

The `config.yaml` file is used to configure the aDNA pipeline. It contains settings such as project name, the species list and the pipeline stages and their process steps.

## Global Settings

* **project\_name**: Name of the aDNA project.

## Pipeline Settings

Defines the overall pipeline behavior, including execution controls and process details.

### Pipeline Stages and Process Steps

* The pipeline is broken into **stages** (e.g., `raw_reads_processing`, `reference_processing`).
* Each stage contains multiple **process steps** (e.g., `adapter_removal`, `deduplication`, ...).
* Both stages and process steps can be controlled with `execute: true/false` flags to enable or disable them.
* Some process steps include additional configurable settings (e.g., adapter sequences, database paths, ...).
* If an enabled process step requires data from a previous stage which is disabled in the config, the pipeline will execute the disabled process step anyway.

### Important Defaults

* You **do not need to specify all stages or process steps** explicitly.
* Any **stage or process step not provided in the config defaults to `execute: true`** and will be executed.
